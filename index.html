  Note: This is a complete course, however, not everything was covered during the course,
  the file that says "Things that were actually covered" is what was went over in the class.
  The other things, were not needed for the completion of the course. In the videos, the
  links that are in red, is what actually was went over.
  
  Note: The assignments are posted in part 2 of the download. Everyting had to be broken
  up into pieces because of how server handles the information... And part 3 has the
  walkthrough videos.

  Note: More courses will be uploaded later. I will work on this later. I am planning to
  have an entire start to finish walkthrough of all courses posted on here. With a
  complete guide, on everything that i've learnt.
 
  The purpose is to simulate an entire learning and earning computer programming diploma
  experience from Seneca College to anyone who wants to learn.
